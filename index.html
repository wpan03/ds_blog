This site stores my blog post for some data science topics. There are definitely many people who understand these topics better than me.

However, I am inspired by the following quote from the book Deep Learning for Coders with *fastai and PyTorch*:

> You are best positioned to help people one step behind you. The material is still fresh in your mind. 
Many experts have forgotten what it was like to be a beginner (or an intermediate) and have forgotten why the topic is hard to understand when you first hear it. 
The context of your particular background, your particular style, and your knowledge level will give a different twist to what youâ€™re writing about.

I will be very happy if my efforts can help someone better understand these topics in their data science journey.
